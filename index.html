        As a young boy back in the 50s I spent plenty of time listening to the radio. On fridays late in the afternoon there was jewish music. It was the beginning of the sabbath.</p>
        <p>Googling around I came across Estrongo Nachama. He was the cantor of the jewish community in berlin from 1945 up to 2000. He must have been one of those I heard on the radio.</p>
        <p>Born as a sephardic jew in Saloniki, Greece, tied into the war, Germany brought there, surviving the shoah, after all he stayed in Berlin. So he had to grow into the ashkenazic culture of his new community. After the wall was built, he helped the devided parts of his community keep in touch with each other.</p> 
        <p >Estrongo Nachama died on january the 13. 2000 in Berlin. More on his life and some impacts he left is here:</p>
